    "CNN is most interesting part in lecture of deeplearning.ai and Nvidia. It handles not existing feature of that time but image data. It has brought enormous advantage. First, it features its distinct structure. From that its method to catch features by using filters to its methods to handle image pixels, there are lots of brilliant things with self-driving car which is my favorite domain of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many research papers about method, technique and optimization of CNN. But this research paper is first thing written about fancy application. It is not easy to understand but quite helpful to understand CNN’s principal and mathematical approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contents of paper\n",
    "#### How it works?\n",
    "##### Approach to art\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, it starts with explaining how to approach to ‘Art’ which is separation of content and style. When it comes to art generated by human, they say It can be explained by complex interplay between content and style. Same in neural model, these two factors are extracted with pre-trained CNN model and regulated by weights and loss functions so that we can make white noise image, initial y, art. Let’s start from beginning again. We need pre-trained CNN and content image that you want to draw and style image that you want to copy its style. In this paper, they use VGG model that have 19 layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Content\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s talk about content first. What we need to know is principal of CNN. When image file enters into CNN model, first few layers catch minor features like edge, line, and motifs. The deeper layers are, the more complex its features that they catch like object. \n",
    "What if we put content image file into CNN? Obviously, its features are caught by each layer. For content image, we are supposed to extract its content as global arrange not as local like motifs. Hence, we are to choose one layer [l] which is not too shallow and not too deep. Next, we put x which is white noise image (randomized image) into CNN model and pick same layer [l] for extracting its content. We can say P and F as respective feature value of content image and x. Square-error loss between P and F is content loss function which is one of two loss functions in this paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Method to extract style representation is quite similar to content’s one. In this part, Gram matrix is introduced to express correlation of its specific layer. Again, Gram matrix is defined correlation for all channels in layer [l]. We can get gram matrix A from style image and G from x, which is also white noise image. Then, E is defined by mean squared error between A and G. And style loss function is defined by E with w, weights for each layer, from [l]=0 to [l]=L. Finally, total loss function is defined by alpha times content loss function plus beta times style loss function. Alpha and beta is regularization factor to control two loss functions. Through this, we can make fancy art with neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the meaning?\n",
    "##### Tool and foundation for other application \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, what is the meaning of this application? They say that it will be useful for wide range of experimental studies concerning visual perception ranging from psychophysics over functional imaging to even electrophysiological neural recordings. And, it can also play role as a study tool for student to understand CNN’s principal and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Review\n",
    "##### Limitation of me\n",
    "\n",
    "Most interesting thing for me is its approach to art. In common deep learning application, we focus on y, which is output, and loss function to adjust parameters which has non-linearity. However, in this paper, output y is art which has three channels, RGB, and they have to derive it from two loss function. It is different problem than conventional problem. That is why I think understanding of CNN in depth has to be preceded before this application. I also suffered from difficulty of understanding of its contents. So, I had to read other information about CNN. It is kind of stage for showing their all knowledge combined creativity, understanding and practical ability. Due to its novel application, not about verifying or improving for existing research, it was very impressive to me after reading this paper. And I realize something programming this application in tensorflow. I had an opportunity to code this application but I felt that it is quite difficult to realize complex application by programming. I thought I am not that bad at programming for machine learning but it was really hard time for me. I think programming is kind of calculator to ease difficulty for machine learning engineer. It brings us lots of advantages. We don’t have to memorize all the methods to build models, but I think I have to step it up to improve my practical skills. Though, I’ve been doing some code from Kaggle, I need to be more eager to reduce my limitation."
